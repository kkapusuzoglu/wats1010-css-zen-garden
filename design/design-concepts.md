#Design Concepts

When I was thinking about my design concept, I wanted to focus on ideas that would create an elegant and pragmatic page. 
After going through the readings, I was struck by how much of the emphasis was on making web pages and sites user friendly.A
The main focus of making a web page user friendly was making it accessible, which entails a couple of things. First, making the 
page's content organized and easily readable. I tried to do this in my wireframe by mimicking the interface design from chapter 4 
of our reading for the week. Specifically, figure 4.17 under the heading "Interface design conventions" For all the reasons
mentioned, I thought that would be a good starting point. 

As for the style, I again looked to our readings to gain ideas. While I really liked the "Steel" zen garden style, after the
readings, I decided to go with more natural colors. I'm thinking of a forest green background with lots of light to keep the
readers attention, but still have a calming affect. It also makes sense semantically, as we are working on the zen "garden" 
Maybe I can incorporate some light blues to mimic water flowing through the forest. My goal is to be simple, but not too
boring.
